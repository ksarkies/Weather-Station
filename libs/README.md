Sensor Libraries
----------------

The following libraries are provided:

1. DHT library for temperature and/or humidity sensors by Freetronics. Forked
   from an Arduino library by Adafruit Industries and adapted to other
   processors and configurations. The Adafruit library is more advanced:
   https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library.

2. Buffer library to manage FIFO buffering for communications.

3. Hardware library to emulate Arduino calls and other necessary features such
   as peripheral initialization and timer ISRs.

4. I2C library.

5. BaroSensor library to handle the I2C barometric pressure sensor.
