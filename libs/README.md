Sensor Libraries
----------------

The following libraries are provided:

1. DHT library for temperature and/or humidity sensors by Freetronics. Forked
   from an Arduino library by Adafruit Industries and adapted to other
   processors and configurations. The Adafruit library is more advanced:
   https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library.

2. Buffer library to manage FIFO buffering for communications.

3. Hardware library to emulate Arduino calls and other necessary features such
   as initialization and ISR.
