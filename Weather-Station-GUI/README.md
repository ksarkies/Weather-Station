Weather Station User Interface
------------------------------

This GUI is intended to run on an attached PC or base station. Its purpose
is to provide a display of current weather conditions, collect stored data and
allow control and configuration of the remote unit.

The GUI is taken substantially from the Battery Management System project with
reuse of the recording module to allow recorded data to be downloaded via the
serial interface. A configuration interface is also available.
