Weather Station Processing Tools
--------------------------------

Provides a GUI for analysing data text files generated by the WS. These are
csv records consisting of an ID and several fields of associated data.

The program scans the file for start and end time, and extracts a list of
record types. The user can then request a number of performance measures over
a specified time interval.

To compile this program, ensure that QT5 is installed.
