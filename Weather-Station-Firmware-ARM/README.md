Weather Station Firmware
--------------------------

The firmware for the remote weather station unit shall provide interfacing to
the sensors in its vicinity. Communication with a base station or external PC
shall be made over a serial cable and/or a wireless network.

The firmware shall power down the unit, which shall wake on interrupt from a
sensor or at regular preset times to take measurements with non-interrupting
sensors and make connection with any attached base station.

The firmware shall also control charging of the backup battery from the
solar panel.
