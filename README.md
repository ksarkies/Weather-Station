Weather Station
---------------

This project aims to produce a weather station consisting of a weatherproofed
processing unit for control and data capture from sensors. This would be
remotely mounted in a suitable location with the sensors and will communicate
with a base station over a serial cable or wirelessly.

The remote unit shall be ARM or AVR based and powered either from the serial
link (if present) and/or from a solar panel with battery backup.

The base station shall collect and store data and permit configuration of the
system via a user interface. It shall consist of a Linux based PC or
microcomputer unit.

The sensors initially shall be taken from a defunct low cost commercial weather
station. Later they may be replaced with scientific grade sensors.

The sensors shall be:

1. Temperature and humidity,
2. Wind Speed,
3. Wind Direction,
4. Rainfall,
5. Air Pressure,
6. Solar Incident Radiation.

The solar panel provided for power shall also be used to measure the incident
solar radiation. This is a measure specific to the panel type and is intended
only for providing records of incident radiation for use in design of solar
power generators having similar panel types.
